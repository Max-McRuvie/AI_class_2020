# AI_class_2020
This is the coursework for my AI class at Napier in 2020. Coursework description:

"A robot has to navigate through a series of small underground caverns connected by straight 
tunnels. Some tunnels can only be navigated in one direction. The robot is given a map of the 
caverns and tunnels which is given as the coordinates of the centre of each cavern, plus a binary 
matrix showing which caverns can be reached from which other caverns."

# Installation and running

Place the caveroute.bat, a_star_algorithm.py, and one of the test input files into the same location. Then open termincal in
the file location the are present and run "caveroute" followed by the desired input files name to run the program.
